# SvelteAndNWJSForWindowsXP
This is a template for creating easily software for Windows XP with NW.js 15.4 (Latest possible version of NWjs that can successfully start on XP, which isn't the publicly known - 14.7). And Sveltekit (because it's pretty lightweight, easy to prototype and use and doesn't take up a loo of drive memory).
